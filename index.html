        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          I've just finished a project using Backbone and I would like to share a few tips, tricks, and libraries that helped me create a non-trivial web-client for an existing API.

        <p>
          I think of Backbone as a MVF, Minimal Viable Framework. Backbone has support for a lot of functionality but as an application developer, you will often have to "Code the last mile" or pick and choose from what is available in backbone to create your ideal framework. If you're starting a completely new application, you'll be able to tailor your back-end to suite a backbone front-end, but often this is a luxury considering that many companies will want to leverage their existing products.
